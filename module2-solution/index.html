               We are proud to be one of the first fully Halal international quick service restaurant (QSR) brands. We serve fresh, great tasting chicken, using only the finest quality herbs and spices, carefully selected from around the world, to deliver exciting flavors in a modern setting. What makes our chicken the best is that we only use the best parts, the chicken breast. Following halal practices, the meat is always manually deboned by our approved suppliers.

The vegetables and salads are as fresh as they come.

These items contain raw or undercooked products. Consuming raw or undercooked seafood may increase your risk of food borne illness especially if you have certain medical conditions
